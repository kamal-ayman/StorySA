Application Policy

Welcome to Story Saver App, an app that allows you to view, save, and share WhatsApp status updates. This policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our app.

Data Collection

Story Saver App collects WhatsApp status updates in the form of images and videos from users who choose to save them using our app. We do not collect any other information from users.

Data Use

The WhatsApp status updates collected by Story Saver App are used to provide users with the ability to view, save, and share the updates. We do not share these updates with any third-party services.

Permissions

To provide you with the best possible experience, Story Saver App requires certain permissions on your device. These permissions are as follows:

WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE: This permission allows the app to save WhatsApp status updates to your device storage.

ACCESS_MEDIA_LOCATION: This permission allows the app to access the location of media files, such as photos and videos. This is necessary for the app to access WhatsApp status updates stored on your device.

MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permission allows the app to create and manage folders in the external storage. With this permission, the app can create new folders for users to save WhatsApp status updates in selected folders from the user and get folder paths.

If the MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permission is not granted, the app will not be able to create folders, and the user will not be able to save stories in their own selected folder. They will have to save the status updates in the default folder provided by the app, and will not be able to organize their saved stories in their preferred manner.

QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES: This permission allows the app to query all installed packages on the device. This is necessary for the app to identify the WhatsApp application on the device and access its status updates.

Data Security

Story Saver App takes the security and confidentiality of user data seriously. We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational measures to prevent unauthorized access and data breaches. We regularly review and update these measures to ensure that user data is protected.

User Control

Users have the ability to control their saved WhatsApp status updates by choosing the folder they wish to save them in. Additionally, they can choose to delete their saved WhatsApp status updates at any time.

Advertising

Story Saver App does not include any third-party advertising.

Updates

We may update this policy from time to time. Users will be notified of any changes through the app or by email.
